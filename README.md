This project contains C++ implementations of a variety of classic and modern numerical techniques, applied to physical problems encountered in laboratory courses and practical assignments. The codebase is designed with clarity, scalability, and reproducibility in mind

---

## ℹ️ About

These laboratory works showcase algorithms for solving core computational physics problems. The implementations are modular and leverage clean C++ patterns to facilitate study, reuse, and extension for new problems

---

## 🔬 Laboratory Topics

### 🧮 Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations (SLAE)

Demonstrates solving tridiagonal and arbitrary systems using direct and iterative methods (e.g., Thomas algorithm, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel), with application to real modeling tasks

### 🌱 Root Finding Algorithms 

Contains implementations of the bisection (dichotomy), Newton, and simple iteration methods for solving non-linear equations. Demonstrates convergence efficiency and robustness on real physical functions

### 📐 Numerical Integration 

Features various quadrature methods (rectangular, trapezoidal, Simpson's), with error analysis and comparisons on benchmark test cases

### 📊 Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) 

Includes explicit and implicit schemes for ODEs, such as Euler, improved Euler and Runge-Kutta methods, tested on classical physical systems (oscillator, decay, etc.)
