## ℹ️ About

These laboratory works showcase algorithms for solving core computational physics problems. The implementations are modular and leverage clean C++ patterns to facilitate study, reuse, and extension for new problems

## 🔬 Laboratory Topics

### Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations (SLAE) 🧮

Demonstrates solving tridiagonal and arbitrary systems using direct and iterative methods (e.g., Thomas algorithm, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel), with application to real modeling tasks

### � Root Finding Algorithms 

Contains implementations of the bisection (dichotomy), Newton, and simple iteration methods for solving non-linear equations. Demonstrates convergence efficiency and robustness on real physical functions

### Numerical Integration 📐

Features various quadrature methods (rectangular, trapezoidal, Simpson's), with error analysis and comparisons on benchmark test cases

### Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) 📊

Includes explicit and implicit schemes for ODEs, such as Euler, improved Euler and Runge-Kutta methods, tested on classical physical systems (oscillator, decay, etc.)
