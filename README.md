# Numerical Methods in Physics

Welcome to the "Numerical Methods in Physics" repository!
This project contains C++ implementations of a variety of classic and modern numerical techniques, applied to physical problems encountered in laboratory courses and practical assignments. The codebase is designed with clarity, scalability, and reproducibility in mind

## About

These laboratory works showcase algorithms for solving core computational physics problems. The implementations are modular and leverage clean C++ patterns to facilitate study, reuse, and extension for new problems

## Laboratory Topics 🔬

### Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations (SLAE) 🧮

Demonstrates solving tridiagonal and arbitrary systems using direct and iterative methods (e.g., Thomas algorithm, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel), with application to real modeling tasks

### Root Finding Algorithms 🌱

Contains implementations of the bisection (dichotomy), Newton, and simple iteration methods for solving non-linear equations. Demonstrates convergence efficiency and robustness on real physical functions

### Numerical Integration 📐

Features various quadrature methods (rectangular, trapezoidal, Simpson's), with error analysis and comparisons on benchmark test cases

### Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) 📊

Includes explicit and implicit schemes for ODEs, such as Euler, improved Euler and Runge-Kutta methods, tested on classical physical systems (oscillator, decay, etc.)
